It took me quite some time to get to this point. After high school, I felt the need to get away from my boring suburban life and spent two years of my life in Israel. After my volunteering service ended, I thought I had enough time to figure out my future profession - becoming a primary school teacher! 

I was so wrong. 

About 1.5 years into my studies, I felt like I had met a dead end. I loved working with children but was shocked by the bureaucracy and time spent on secondary work. When I moved from Berlin to Leipzig, a high school friend came to visit, and after we talked about my struggles with my current studies, he suggested applying for dual studies at Deutsche Telekom. I always had good grades in computer science, but I didn't dare apply to such studies due to my bad maths grades. After the whole application process was done, I was accepted and started my bachelor studies for "Business Information Systems" in October 2018. After I got used to the changes - coming from free studies following a loose path to having a strict three-year plan - I just finally had the motivation to get a better understanding of programming. 

In December 2021, I finally finished my studies, and I have collected a ton of work experience within a network development team. We found a kind of symbiosis by combining my programming experiences with their network expertise. Before I started, topics like automation and agile development mainly were ignored due to a lack of programmers and time.

I took my chances and studied even in my free time to get sufficient technical knowledge to prove my way of work. I knew some essential web development and got my way around basic python when I started. Then, I took it on myself to learn Django autodidactically with all its underlying concepts. When I could present the first solution - real-time firewall ruleset extracts - I got more and more support for my intent. 

On the way, I had to figure out how to deploy apps properly. After some forth and back, I could get my first hands-on experience in cloud development and CI/CD. I've got to work on topics I never thought I would ever have to deal with.

Anywho - after 2.5 years, I still didn't get an internal job offer for the time after I finished my studies, so I had to apply for jobs all over the country and was quite insecure about my skillset so far. In the end, it might have been better than I thought when I got a mail with an invitation for a position I thought I couldn't get. 

I've landed my first real job! From January '22, I'll work as a DevOps 
Engineer, and I'm really excited to start this position. I want to start this blog to celebrate what I've learned so far and to document my future journey. If my experiences might help somebody else on their journey, I'm also happy to do that.
